Analog Devices AD5758 DAC device driver

Required properties for the AD5758:
	- compatible: Must be "adi,ad5758"
	- reg: SPI chip select number for the device
	- spi-max-frequency: Max SPI frequency to use (< 50000000)
	- spi-cpha: is the only mode that is supported

Optional properties:

 - reset-gpios : GPIO spec for the RESET pin. If specified, it will be
 		 asserted during driver probe.

 - adi,dc-dc-mode: Mode of operation of the dc-to-dc converter
		   The following values are currently supported:
		   	* 0: DC-to-DC converter powered off
			* 1: DPC current mode
			* 2: DPC voltage mode
			* 3: PPC current mode

 - adi,dc-dc-ilim: The dc-to-dc converter current limit
		   The following values are currently supported [mA]:
		   	* 150
			* 200
			* 250
			* 300
			* 350
			* 400

 - adi,slew-time-us: The time it takes for the output to reach the full scale [uS]
 		     The supported range is between 133us up to 1023984375us

 - adi,range: The output range
	      The following values are currently supported:
	      	* 0: 0 V to 5 V voltage range
		* 1: 0 V to 10 V voltage range
		* 2: ±5 V voltage range
		* 3: ±10 V voltage range
		* 8: 0 mA to 20 mA current range
		* 9: 0 mA to 24 mA current range
		* 10: 4 mA to 20 mA current range
		* 11: ±20 mA current range
		* 12: ±24 mA current range
		* 13: −1 mA to +22 mA current range

AD5758 Example:

	ad5758@0 {
		compatible = "adi,ad5758";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		spi-cpha;

		reset-gpios = <&gpio 22 0>;

		adi,dc-dc-mode = <2>;
		adi,dc-dc-ilim = <200>;
		adi,slew-time-us = <125000>;
		adi,range = <1>;
	};
